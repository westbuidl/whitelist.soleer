      question: "What is Soleer?",
      answer: "Soleer is the first peer-to-peer (P2P) service marketplace built on the Solana blockchain. It connects freelancers and clients, enabling them to transact services in a fast, transparent, and cost-effective manner using blockchain technology"
    },
    {
      question: "How does Soleer work?",
      answer: "Soleer operates as a decentralized marketplace where Freelancers (Service Providers) offer services, create listings, and receive payments in cryptocurrency.<br /><br />Clients can browse, hire freelancers, and make payments using Soleer's escrow system, which ensures secure transactions.<br /><br />All interactions are secured via smart contracts, ensuring that payments are only released once both parties are satisfied."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the benefit of using Soleer over traditional platforms?",
      answer: "Low Fees: Transactions on Soleer incur significantly lower fees than traditional freelance platforms, thanks to Solana's low-cost blockchain.<br /><br />Speed: Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second, ensuring fast and efficient interactions.<br /><br />Transparency: All transactions and user reputations are stored on the blockchain, making them verifiable and immutable.<br /><br />Security: Smart contracts ensure payments are held in escrow until the work is completed, offering protection for both freelancers and clients.<br /><br />Decentralization: Soleer eliminates central authorities, reducing the risk of censorship or unfair practices."
    },
    {
      question: "How do payments work on Soleer?",
      answer: "All payments on Soleer are handled via cryptocurrency.<br /><br />When a client hires a freelancer, the agreed-upon payment is held in an escrow smart contract on the Solana blockchain. Once the freelancer delivers the work and the client approves it, the funds are released from escrow"
    },
    {
      question: "What currencies can I use on Soleer?",
      answer: "Soleer primarily uses Solana (SOL) for transactions, but additional cryptocurrency options may be supported as the platform evolves.<br /><br />You will need a compatible Solana wallet to engage in transactions."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the reputation system work?",
      answer: "Soleer's reputation system is based on user ratings and feedback, stored transparently on the blockchain.<br /><br />Freelancers are rated by clients based on the quality of work, communication, and adherence to deadlines.<br /><br />Similarly, clients are rated by freelancers for professionalism and timely payments.<br /><br />These ratings help users build trust and visibility on the platform."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I resolve disputes?",
      answer: "In case of a disagreement between a freelancer and a client, Soleer provides a dispute resolution mechanism:<br /><br />1. Direct Communication: Users are encouraged to resolve issues through direct dialogue.<br /><br />2. Escalation to Arbitration: If no agreement is reached, the dispute can be escalated, and smart contracts will enforce the agreed terms. Neutral third-party arbiters may be used to make a final decision.<br /><br />3. Smart Contracts: Payments held in escrow will only be released based on the resolution of the dispute."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I create a profile on Soleer?",
      answer: "To create a profile:<br /><br />1. Sign up on Soleer using your email address and link your Solana wallet.<br /><br />2. Complete your profile by providing relevant personal information, your skills, and portfolio if you are a freelancer.<br /><br />3. You're ready to start offering services or hiring talent on the platform!"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I hire a freelancer on Soleer?",
      answer: "1. Browse available freelancers or services through the platform's search functionality.<br /><br />2. Review their profile, past work, and ratings.<br /><br />3. Contact the freelancer to discuss your project details and agree on terms.<br /><br />4. Once agreed, deposit the payment into the escrow smart contract.<br /><br />5. Upon satisfactory completion, release the payment to the freelancer."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I offer services as a freelancer on Soleer?",
      answer: "1. Complete your profile and clearly define the services you offer.<br /><br />2. List your services with detailed descriptions, prices, and timelines.<br /><br />3. Respond to client inquiries and negotiate terms as needed.<br /><br />4. Once hired, deliver the agreed-upon services and receive payment upon the client's approval."
    },
    {
      question: "What is escrow, and how does it work?",
      answer: "Escrow is a secure payment mechanism where funds are held by a third-party (in this case, a smart contract on the blockchain) until both parties fulfill their agreement.<br /><br />On Soleer, client payments are held in escrow until the freelancer delivers the work and the client approves it."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel a project after hiring a freelancer?",
      answer: "Yes, but only if both parties agree to cancel the project.<br /><br />If a freelancer has already started work, cancellation terms and refunds will depend on the terms agreed upon during the project's negotiation phase.<br /><br />In case of disputes, Soleer's dispute resolution process can be used."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I protect myself from scams or low-quality work?",
      answer: "Soleer's escrow system ensures that payments are not released until the work is completed and approved by the client.<br /><br />The platform's transparent reputation system also helps users assess the credibility and reliability of freelancers and clients before starting a project."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I withdraw earnings as a freelancer?",
      answer: "Once your client approves the work, the payment held in escrow will be released to your Solana wallet.<br /><br />From there, you can transfer your earnings to any supported cryptocurrency wallet or exchange."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Soleer available worldwide?",
      answer: "Yes, Soleer is a global platform. By using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments, freelancers and clients from anywhere in the world can transact without traditional banking limitations."
    },
    {
      question: "How does Soleer ensure security?",
      answer: "Blockchain Security: Transactions are secured on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.<br /><br />Smart Contracts: All payments are managed by smart contracts, reducing the risk of fraud or payment disputes.<br /><br />Reputation System: The transparent, immutable reputation system helps identify trustworthy freelancers and clients."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use Soleer on mobile?",
      answer: "Yes, Soleer can be accessed via mobile-friendly web interfaces.<br /><br />The platform will offer mobile apps as well for a better user experience on smartphones and tablets."
    },
    {
